A text image with a pure white background displaying the title "Production of Different Crops In An Area" split into two lines. The first line reads: "Production of Different Crops" and the second line reads: "In An Area". The text is centered horizontally and vertically with ample blank space above and below. The word "Crops" on the first line is emphasized by making it noticeably larger than the other words, rendered in a deep green color, and each letter in "Crops" is filled with a subtle texture of wheat stalks and leaves. The letter "O" in "Crops" is replaced with an icon of a golden ear of wheat enclosed within a circular frame that blends seamlessly into the letterform. The rest of the text is in a clean, serif font with a classical, slightly bold weight, color dark brown. All text except "Crops" is uniformly styled and aligned baseline. The overall font style is classical with an agricultural elegance, avoiding any futuristic, cartoonish, or anime characteristics. There are no artistic distortions such as cracks, melting, or burning; the text remains crisp and professional. The layout strictly follows the two-line structure with no additional elements beyond the specified icon substitution and text styling.
