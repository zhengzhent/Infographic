A visually appealing, modern flat vector illustration depicting diverse agricultural crops arranged harmoniously in a geometric pattern on a pure white background. Show stylized representations of wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, and potatoes growing from orderly rectangular plots with subtle soil textures beneath them. Use vibrant but natural color palettes for each crop type with clean outlines and subtle gradients for depth. Arrange the crops in an abstract field composition with gentle perspective to suggest volume and space. Include minimal decorative elements like sun rays peeking from one corner and soft cloud shapes in negative space to suggest a growing environment. Maintain a clean, minimalist aesthetic with no text, words, or letters - pure visual communication only. Ensure professional execution suitable for infographics with crisp vector-style edges and balanced composition that leaves ample negative space around elements. Illustration should convey agricultural productivity through visual variety while maintaining cohesion through consistent stylistic treatment of all crops. Absolutely no handwritten elements, labels, or textual components - solely symbolic representation through crops and environment.
