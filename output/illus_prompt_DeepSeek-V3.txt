A clean, modern vector illustration depicting diverse crops growing in a stylized farm landscape, arranged in an organized grid pattern on a pure white background. The composition should feature rows of different agricultural plants (wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, and vegetables) represented with flat, colorful geometric shapes in a minimalist style. Each crop type should be distinctively stylized with subtle textures and shading while maintaining visual harmony. Include abstract representations of farming elements like irrigation lines and sun rays radiating gently in the background, all rendered with crisp edges and bold colors. The illustration must be perfectly balanced with negative space for infographic elements, using a contemporary color palette dominated by greens, yellows, and earth tones. Absolutely no text, words, labels, or any typographic elements should appear - only pure visual representation of agricultural production concepts through symbolic crop illustrations. The overall aesthetic should be professional, informative, and visually striking while remaining simple enough not to overpower accompanying infographic data.
