A modern sans-serif font displaying "Production of Different Crops In An Area" centered on a pure white background, split into two lines: "PRODUCTION OF DIFFERENT CROPS" on the top line in larger bold dark green letters, and "IN AN AREA" on the bottom line in slightly smaller bold brown letters. Surround the text with minimalist outline icons of wheat, corn, and rice stalks subtly integrated into the negative space without replacing any letters. Use clean typography with slight embossing effect for dimension while maintaining crisp edges and full readability against the stark white background. Ensure generous blank space above and below the text block.
