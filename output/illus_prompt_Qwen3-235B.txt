A clean, modern isometric illustration depicting a diverse agricultural landscape showing multiple crop types grown in distinct adjacent plots, arranged in an organized, visually balanced layout on a pure white background. The scene includes raised farm beds with clear visual separation between different crops such as wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, tomatoes, and leafy greens, each represented with accurate, detailed plant textures and natural color variations to distinguish them. Include subtle elevation differences and gentle shadowing for depth, with soft, natural lighting emphasizing the freshness and variety of the crops. Integrate small farming elements like irrigation lines, wooden borders, and gently winding footpaths to suggest human management without cluttering the scene. Render in a semi-realistic vector art style with smooth surfaces, sharp edges, and professional precision, ensuring visual clarity and aesthetic harmony. The composition should be top-down slightly angled (isometric perspective) to allow clear recognition of each crop zone while maintaining a spacious, uncluttered feel. Absolutely no text, labels, numbers, letters, captions, or written content of any kind should appear anywhere in the image. Focus exclusively on visual storytelling through realistic plant forms and spatial organization to convey agricultural diversity and productivity. The level of detail should be moderately high—sufficient to distinguish crop types clearly but remaining minimalist enough to avoid visual overload, making it ideal for integration into a modern infographic design without competing with data elements.
