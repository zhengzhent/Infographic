Generate a text image with the text "Production of Different Crops In An Area" arranged in two centered lines: "Production of Different Crops" on the top line and "In An Area" on the bottom line. Emphasize "Different Crops" by enlarging the font size and using vibrant green and golden-yellow colors for each letter alternately. Replace the letter "o" in "Crops" with a small wheat icon. Use a bold, modern sans-serif font with crisp edges and no shadows. Apply a subtle gradient effect to the letters without any surface cracks or melting. Ensure the text spans nearly the entire canvas with minimal white space around the edges. The background must be pure white with no additional decorations or patterns.
