Generate a minimalist vertical bar chart: the input is a set of (category, value) pairs, sorted in ascending order by value to ensure the bar heights increase from left to right, matching the layout of the reference chart. The bottoms of all bars are aligned on the same horizontal baseline, and the bar heights are proportional to their values, with uniform width and equal horizontal spacing between bars. Each bar should be a rectangular shape with a triangular top, resembling a pyramid shape, using a consistent style with no gradients, textures, or shadow effects. The chart should retain only a baseline at the bottom, without drawing a y-axis, tick marks, grid lines, title, or legend. For each bar, place the category label text centered horizontally below the bar, with the content as the categories from the input data. Place the value label text centered horizontally above the top of each bar, with the content as the corresponding values. Leave sufficient padding around the edges of the canvas to ensure enough space for the value labels at the top and the category labels at the bottom, without adding any additional decorative elements. The color of the chart is determined by the title, and the background is transparent, showing only the chart elements and the underlying canvas background.
