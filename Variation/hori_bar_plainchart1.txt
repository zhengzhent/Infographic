Generate a minimalist horizontal bar chart: the input is a set of (category, value) pairs, sorted in ascending order by value to ensure the bar lengths increase from left to right, matching the layout of the reference chart. The left ends of all bars are aligned on the same horizontal baseline, and the bar lengths are proportional to their values, with uniform width and equal vertical spacing between bars. Each bar should be a rectangular shape with a flat top, resembling a square top for each bar, with the bar body remaining vertical, using a consistent style. The chart should retain only a baseline on the left, without drawing an x-axis, tick marks, grid lines, title, or legend. For each bar, place the value label text centered horizontally to the right of the bar, with the content as the values from the input data. Place the category label text centered horizontally to the left of the bar, with the content as the corresponding categories. Leave sufficient padding around the edges of the canvas to ensure enough space for the category labels on the left and the value labels on the right, without adding any additional decorative elements. The color of the chart is determined by the title, and the background is transparent, showing only the chart elements and the underlying canvas background.
