Generate a minimalist vertical bar chart: the input is a set of (category, value) pairs; before drawing the chart, first sort the data by value in ascending order so that the bar heights strictly follow an increasing trend from left to right, consistent with the reference chart; then create one vertical bar for each data item, placing the bars from left to right in this sorted order with equal spacing and equal width, with all bar bottoms aligned on the same horizontal baseline and heights proportional to their values. Each bar should be a pill-shaped vertical rectangle with rounded top and bottom, using a consistent style and no gradients, textures, or shadow effects. The chart should keep only a single baseline at the bottom and should not draw a y-axis, tick marks, grid lines, title, or legend. For each bar, place the category label text centered horizontally below the bar, using the category from the data, and place the value label text centered horizontally above the top of the bar, using the corresponding value from the data. Leave sufficient padding around the edges of the canvas so there is enough space for the value labels at the top and the category labels at the bottom, and do not add any other decorative elements. The color of the chart is determined by the title, and the chart background is transparent so that only the chart elements themselves and the underlying canvas background are visible.
